# 🔢 Project Description: Even Number Counter

This simple Python script calculates and outputs the total count of even numbers within a specific range.

# 🎯 Goal
The primary purpose of this script is to demonstrate the use of the modulo operator (%) and a for loop to efficiently determine
the quantity of even integers in a given sequence.

# ⚙️ How It Works
1. Initialization: A variable named list_size is initialized to 0. This acts as the counter for the even numbers found.\
2. Iteration: The script uses a for loop to iterate through all integers starting from 2 up to (but not including) 50.
3. Even Check: Inside the loop, the conditional statement if i % 2 == 0: checks if
   the current number (i) is perfectly divisible by 2 (i.e., has a remainder of 0).
4. Counting: If the number is even, the list_size counter is incremented by 1.
5. Output: Finally, the script prints the total count of even numbers found in that range.

# 🚀 Usage

To run this script:
1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., even_counter.py).
2. Execute it from your terminal:

       python even_counter.py
Output: The script will output the number
